This library contains useful classes for creating and rendering two-\/dimensional noise maps containing coherent noise that was generated from the libnoise library. These classes are used to create procedural textures and terrain height maps.

noiseutils is known to compile under Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 (using Microsoft Visual C++ 5.\+0) and under Gentoo Linux 10.\+0 (using gcc 3.\+3.\+4). It should be portable across all platforms that can compile libnoise.\hypertarget{index_classes}{}\section{Classes}\label{index_classes}
This library contains the following classes\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A {\itshape noise map} class\+: This class implements a two-\/dimensional array that stores floating-\/point values. It's designed to store coherent-\/noise values generated by a noise module.
\item Several {\itshape noise-\/map builder} classes\+: Each of these classes fills a noise map with coherent-\/noise values generated by a noise module. While filling a noise map, it iterates the coordinates of the input value along the surface of a specific mathematical object. Each of these classes implements a different mathematical object, such as a plane, a cylinder, or a sphere.
\item An {\itshape image} class\+: This class implements a two-\/dimensional array that stores color values.
\item Several {\itshape image-\/renderer} classes\+: these classes render images given the contents of a noise map. Each of these classes renders an image in a different way.
